BUGFIXES:
    Load more on messages does not work... (try using $messages[] from the initial populate_msg.php in the load_more_ajax.php)
    When clicking on friends, you can't report (no roomname)


FIXED:
    Sending messages with enters does not work, causes error
    The user sending the request can accept the request for them
    Change collation of sql database to be case sensitive
